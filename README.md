# HasznaltautoWebCrawler - hasznaltauto.hu

This is my first attempt to scrape data from a website. My intentions were to scrape used car data and its pictures, save it into a relational database. I used Selenium to do so, it isn't the fastest way...but at least I've gotten to know the Selenium library. It opens a Chrome browser and the algorithm takes us through just like we would manually and scrapes the needed data.

## Data Analysis
 - (Compressing/Comparing pictures) See if someone uses the same picture for multiple cars either at once, or in different times (this will come in handy in another project*)
 
 
 *On ingatlan.com there are lazy real-estate agents who use the same pictures for multiple property. This is dominant in case of searching for a 'telek' (plot of land). The problem with is is when people are looking for a property there is an option to filter out all the ads that don't have pictures. These lazy agents get away with not putting up a pictures and still showing up in the search results.
